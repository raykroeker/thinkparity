thinkParity has been designed to be very easy to learn and use. When you work with packages, documents or contacts, you simply right-click on them to see what actions are available. You don't need to worry about making mistakes because actions that don't make sense will simply not appear. For example, the publish action is available once you create a working version and either add, modify or remove at least one document.

To expand or collapse a package, click on the + button or double click the name of the package. Contacts and help topics can be expanded and collapsed in the same way.

<p>When you expand a package, the package versions are listed on the left. Information about the package or version is displayed on the right. You can open a document by double-clicking on the document name, or by single-clicking on the icon next to the document name.

To familiarize yourself with the application, take a few moments to right-click on various portions of the display to see the list of available actions.
