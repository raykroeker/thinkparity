To make changes to the documents in a package:
1 - Expand the package.
2 - Click the 'Reply' button. You will see a new row in the package called 'Working Version'.
3 - Open a document, make changes, and save changes as normal. You do not need to use the 'Save As' command when you save your changes.
4 - To add a document to the package, click the 'More Actions' button and select 'Add Documents'. Alternatively you can drag and drop a document to the package from Windows Explorer (TM).

<p>Only one person can work on a new version at a time. You can tell if somebody else is working on a new version because their name appears on the right side of the package.

To work on a new version you must have the most recent version of the package, and you must be online.
