  Calpurnia Pisonis
    Daughter of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi, was a Roman woman, third and last
wife of Julius Caesar. They married in 59 BC with no children resulting from
the union. According to sources1 Calpurnia had a premonition of her husband's
murder and tried to warn him in vain. In Shakespeare's play, Calpurnia has a
dream that a statue of Caesar is flowing with blood as many Romans wash their
hands in the blood.
