A package is organized as a list of versions. To see the versions in a package, click the '+' icon to the left of the package name to expand the package. The 'Working Version' is listed first (if there is one), followed by the historical versions, with the most recent version at the top.

Each historical version is a snapshot of the package at the time it was published.

When you click on a historical version, you can see who published the version, who received the version and when, and what documents were changed, added or removed in that version.

<p>To open a document, click on the document icon. You cannot make changes to the documents of a historical version.

<p>To forward a historical version to a new person, right-click on the version and select 'Forward Version' from the menu.
