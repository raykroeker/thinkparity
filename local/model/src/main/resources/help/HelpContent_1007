A notification is a small dialog that appears on the bottom right of your screen when something important arrives. You receive a notification when a new package arrives, when a package is updated, or when a person invites you to be their contact.

You can click on the notification title to view the package or invitation, or simply close the notification. You can also move between multiple notifications if they arrive at the same time by clicking on the 'next' and 'previous' links.

If you close the thinkParity window, thinkParity runs in the background so you continue to receive notifications.
