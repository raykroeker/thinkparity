Even when the thinkParity window is closed, thinkParity is still running in the background so you can be notified if somebody sends you a new package.

To exit thinkParity:
1 - Locate the thinkParity taskbar icon on the Windows taskbar (usually on the lower right of your screen).
2 - Right-click on the icon and select 'Exit' from the menu.
