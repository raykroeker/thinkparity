Once you have created a working version and made your changes, you are ready to publish those changes to your colleagues. To do this, right-click on the package and select 'Publish'.

Within the publish dialogue you first enter a name for the version. If you choose not to enter a name, a default name will be provided. Next, select who you want to publish the package to. thinkParity lists all existing participants of the package and automatically selects those which have received the latest version. If you want to include another participant, simply check the box next to his or her name. You can also uncheck a name if you don't want that person to receive the version. If the person is not your contact yet, you can enter their e-mail address. You can type several e-mail addresses, separated with commas.
<p>Once you click 'Publish', the package is sent. You will see up-to-date information about the version and its recipients. For example, when a recipient receives the version, the icon next to their name changes colour. 

It is important to note that unlike traditional e-mail, thinkParity communicates through a secure communications channel using industry standard levels of encryption. As such, when publishing packages all documents and related data are protected at all times to prevent unauthorized access.
