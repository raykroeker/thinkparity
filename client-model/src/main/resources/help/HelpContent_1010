When you no longer work with a package on a day-to-day basis, you can remove it from your active package tab by archiving it. Archiving a package will also remove you from the list of active participants. You can continue to work with your archived packages in the same way as before, except that you are not able to create a working version or publish an archived package.

You can also restore a package which will add you to the active participants list and move the package back to the default tab.
