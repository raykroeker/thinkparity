A delivery notification is a small dialog that appears on the bottom right of your screen when something important has arrived. You will receive a delivery notification when new packages arrive, when a package is updated, or when a person has invited you to be their contact. You can click on the notification to view the package or invitation, or simply close the notification. You can also move between multiple notifications if they arrive at the same time by clicking on the 'next' and 'previous' links.
