thinkParity offers a backup service that protects you against the possibility of data loss. If you lose your laptop, or if a fire in your office destroys your PC, thinkParity's backup service allows you to restore all of your packages with a few clicks. In case of such an event, you will simply need to get yourself a new laptop or PC and login to your thinkParity account. You will find your packages the same way you had left them. 

The backup service is not available to Guest accounts.
