You can bookmark a package by selecting the icon to the left of its name. The colour of the package icon changes to orange.

A bookmark can help give a visual cue to the packages you were most recently working on. You can use a filter to show only packages that you've bookmarked. This is an easy and practical way of organizing your most active projects.
