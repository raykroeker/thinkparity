Most of the time thinkParity starts without asking you for your username and password. You need to type your username and password if you login on a new computer.

To change your password, click on your name located in the bottom right of thinkParity, then click the 'Change Password' button.

If you have forgotten your password, contact us at www.thinkParity.com/contactUs and we will be happy to help you change it. You will need to have the answer to your security question that you entered when you created your account.
