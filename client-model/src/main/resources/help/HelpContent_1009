All of your contacts are stored and organized in the Contacts tab, similar to an address book. Unlike a traditional address book, you never need to manually update your contacts' information. When one of your contacts updates his information the changes are brought to you automatically, so your contact information is always up-to-date.

To view contact details, click the '+' icon to the left of the contact name.

<p>There are two ways a person can become your contact. In the expanded package, right click on a person who you would like to be your contact and select 'invite' from the menu. Or, in the publish dialog, type the e-mail address of the person. The person will receive an invitation from you.

If the person you invite is not a thinkParity user, he will receive an e-mail on your behalf inviting him to become a member of thinkParity and use the service for free as your guest.

<p>To delete a contact relationship, right-click on a contact and select 'Delete' from the menu. The contact will disappear from your contact tab, and at the same time your name will be removed from the other person's contact tab.
