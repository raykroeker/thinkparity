thinkParity's backup service safeguards your valuable documents from accidental loss or corruption. If you lose your laptop, or if a fire in your office destroys your PC, thinkParity's backup service allows you to restore all of your packages and contacts with a few clicks.

To restore thinkParity on a new computer, re-install thinkParity and start the application. In the wizard that appears, select the option 'I already have a thinkParity account' and enter your username and password. Your data including pages and contacts will be restored from the secure thinkParity server.
