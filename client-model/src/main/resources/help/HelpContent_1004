thinkParity comes with a built in search engine allowing you to find documents and packages quickly and easily. You may remember the name of a document that you have received in a package, or perhaps only the company of the person who sent it to you. Enter this text in the search control, and the contents of the tab will be updated.

Once you find a package you may decide to open and work with its documents or to bookmark it for future reference. By removing the search criteria, you can return to your default list.

<p>If you are looking for packages you are currently working on, you can filter your list so you only see the packages that you have bookmarked or the packages with working versions. To do this, click the magnifying glass icon within the search control and select a filter from the menu that appears.

You can also search for contacts or help topics in the same way.
